# webscrapping
Python web‐scraping project that fetches quotes from http://quotes.toscrape.com using requests and BeautifulSoup, extracting text and author into a pandas DataFrame. It demonstrates basic data exploration—counting quotes per author, filtering by keyword, computing quote lengths—and saves the results to a CSV file.
